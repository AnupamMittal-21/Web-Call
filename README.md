# Web-Call
I created an chatting app , where you can chat with your friends.
Hello there, 
Me and my team, “The Coding Squad” developed an  chatting app named “Web Chat”.
  Web Chat have the following basic structure.
1). Splash screen :- with the logo of app and logo of our team name

 


 

2). Login page:- You can authenticate yourself with email and password. 
 

3). SignUp page:- you need to create an account before login , So here is your SignUp screen 
 
 

4). Chatting page:- here  we have used recycler view in order to display user data stored at firebase database. 
 

5). Logout button: on the top you will find the logout button which will redirect you to the login screen 
6).Private Chat Rooms:- here you can chat with your friends
 
Further Vision of App :
1). To have features of video and voice calling.
2). To have different themes which user can select according to their preferences for full app
3). Virtual DP creater : here you can customise your own character like hairs, skin colour and much more
And much more…
