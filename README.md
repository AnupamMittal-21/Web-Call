I created an chatting app , where you can chat with your friends.
Hello there, 
Me and my team, “The Coding Squad” developed an  chatting app named “Web Chat”.
Web Chat have the following basic structure.

Further Vision of App :
1). To have features of video and voice calling.
2). To have different themes which user can select according to their preferences for full app
3). Virtual DP creater : here you can customise your own character like hairs, skin colour and much more

And much more…
